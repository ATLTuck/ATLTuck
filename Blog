Howdy!

This is going to be the new home of my blog, were I'll discuss what projects 
I'm working on as well as sharing any resources I come across that seem useful.

I'm currently VERY into exploring AWS, but a few of my other interests are Software Defined Radio, 
Blockchain, 3D Printing, InfoSec, Raspberry Pi projects, and VST instruments.

I look forward to sharing more in the near future as I have time to add more to my repos!

See you soon,

Bryan

P.S. Do something to help someone today. It will mean more to you than you expect!
